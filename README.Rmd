Installing the application requires R Studio, and the installation of several packages. 
To install the required R packages, please open run_me_before_startup.R and run this file. This should install all necessary packages.
If an error is thrown during installation, try to install that package manually or update your Rstudio.
After package installation, the application is best ran in developer mode for full access to debugging output.
To run the application in developer mode, navigate to the "tsim/dev" folder, and open the "run_dev.R" file in RStudio.
After running this file, the application should run without any other issues.
Should any problems still occur, the application is still available at https://tsim.timleers.com for testing.
Note that the version on the website does not allow for debugging output.
